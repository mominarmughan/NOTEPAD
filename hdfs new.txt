hdfs command
              The /user/ directory is owned by "hdfs" with 755 permissions
			   As a result only hdfs can write to that directory
			   Unlike unix/linux, hdfs is the superuser and not root. So you would need to do this:

            make directory
			sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -mkdir /user/,,myfile,,
            sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -put myfile.txt /user/,,/,,
			
			if you want root as a hdfs superuser you do this stap
			sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -mkdir /user/root
			sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -chown root /user/root
          
		  Then as root you can do "hadoop fs -put file /user/root/".
